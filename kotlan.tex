\section*{Abstract}

Numerous technical applications work with disks of general cross sections pressed or freely put on shafts and rotating at high revolutions \cite{skopek}, \cite{kim}. We can mention, for example, active wheels of gas or steam turbines and axial compressors, rotors of centrifugal separators, fly-wheels realized either as stabilizers of various mechanical systems or as high-revolution superconductive accumulators of energy and so forth. The paper deals with the determination of the mechanical situation (stresses and displacements) in such devices, whose knowledge will be later used for overall evaluation of properties of shrink fits disk-shaft prepared by means of induction heating. This kind of problem should be solved like contact problem. Authors present an iterative procedure of its solution. After presenting the technical formulation of the problem, it is described by an appropriate mathematical model given by the Lam√© equation supplemented with correct boundary conditions \cite{pantelyat}. This model is then repeatedly solved numerically by the finite element analysis. The principal part of the paper consists in the discussion of results obtained by the solution of several illustrative examples.
