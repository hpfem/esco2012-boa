\section*{Abstract}

In this talk we consider a nonconforming discretization of scalar elliptic problem. For construction of efficient preconditioner the semi-coarsening approach \cite{R1} will be applied. Different constructions of hierarchical two-level splitting of the finite element space are presented. Uniform estimates for the related constants in the strengthened CBS  inequality are derived. Combining this results with the theory of the hybrid V-cycle multilevel methods \cite{R2} we obtain an optimal order multilevel preconditioner. The generalization of the method to 3D problems will be discussed.
