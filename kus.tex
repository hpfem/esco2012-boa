\section*{Abstract}

The process of induction heating of cylindrical nonmagnetic billets is modeled. An unmoving billet is placed in rotating magnetic field generated by permanent magnets mounted on a ferromagnetic ring. The ring with the magnets represents an external rotor of the device that is driven by an asynchronous motor by means of a teeth gear. The coupled model of the problem consisting of two partial differential equations describing the distributions of magnetic and temperature fields in the system is solved by a fully adaptive higher-order finite element method. Computations are realized by own code Agros2d developed in our department. The system is then optimized with respect to the thickness of the air gap and angular velocity of rotation. The optimization procedure represents a supplement of the code. The methodology is illustrated by a typical example whose results are discussed.
