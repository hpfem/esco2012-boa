\section*{Abstract}

It is well known that the dynamical behavior of a linear or nonlinear electrical network may in principle be described by a set of state equations together with the so called output equation. The output equation determines the amount of information about the internal state contained in the observed output signal. Any such mathematical structure is called state space representation of the network. The state variables may be taken as coordinates of a state vector x(t) referred to a basis in a Euclidean space of n dimensions, called the state space X of the system representation R{S}. Each solution of the state equations corresponding to an initial state and/or to an input control signal determines a state space trajectory \cite{kalman}. 

From a physical point of view to any such trajectory corresponds some course of a total energy accumulated in the actual state of the given system. Any state space representation of a system having a particularly simple or useful structure is called canonical. One of the most useful canonical state space representations in electrical network theory are known as Brayton-Moser equations \cite{stork-hrusak-mayer}. It is well known that a relatively large class of real world systems, at least in principle, admits to start the modeling phase of the given situation using Hamilton`s principle of clasical mechanics either in the form of Euler-Lagrange equations or in the form of Hamilton canonical equations. In spite of the fact that the Hamilton principle has originally been formulated for class of mechanical systems only, it is now well known that from a general point of view the specific physical nature of the system does not play any essential role. On the other hand it is important to notice that in the process of deriving both the sets of equations a crucial role plays a proper representation of the energy storage in the state space of the system.In this paper, a class of linear and especially nonlinear systems is discussed. A conceptually new approach is based on the idea that abstract state space energy can be measured by a distance of the actual state $x(t)$ from the equilibrium. The proposed state space energy based approach seems to open a new perspective in development of sufficiently universal and more adequate abstract system representations for variety of natural systems. Crucial feature of the proposed approach is that all the derived results have to be structurally consistent with two fundamental laws of nature -- the causality principle as well as with the energy conservation principle.
