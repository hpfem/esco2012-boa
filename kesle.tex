\section*{Abstract}

This work deals with numerical modelling of incompressible flow for generalized Newtonian fluids. The governing system of equations is based on the system of balance laws for mass and momentum. The generalized Newtonian fluids differ through choice of a viscosity function. A power-law model is used for non-Newtonian viscosity function. The unsteady system of equations with steady boundary conditions is solved by FVM. In the case of unsteady computation an artificial compressibility method with using dual-time stepping method and a projection method with unsteady boundary conditions are considered. The flow is modelled in a bounded computational domain.
