\section*{Abstract}

Cloud computation technologies open a new perspective for scientific computing. Sophisticated software
can now be made available as on-demand service, reducing costs and broadening accessibility for end-users.
The paper presents an implementation of a system serving open source electromagnetic field simulation software
as a web based service.
The primary users of the system are medical staff and electromagnetic
safety engineers which are usually not familiar with field simulation methods. The user friendliness of a system
combined with its flexibility, scalability and extendibility is realized with help of carefully designed
concept of configurable usage-scenarios. Our aim is to present this scenarios concept in detail.
