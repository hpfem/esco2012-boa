\section*{Abstract}

We present reliable a-posteriori error estimates for $hp$-adaptive finite element approximations
of semi-definite eigenvalue/eigenvector problems. Our model problems are motivated by
the applications in photonic-crystal eigenvalue computations. Starting from our previous work on large coupling limits
of spectral problems \cite{SC}, we develop an extension of the (positive definite) a-posteriori estimation framework from \cite{LO}.
Our eigenvalue and eigenvector error estimation scheme is particularly tailored to the structure of spectral problems 
with known null spaces (which is the case in our photonic-crystal model problem). 
Furthermore, the estimators are provably reliable and efficient. We present detailed numerical experiments confirming our theory and give several benchmark results which could serve the purpose of numerical testing of other adaptive procedures.
