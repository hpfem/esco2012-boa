\section*{Abstract}

General linear methods can have favorable properties: it is possible to find
A-stable methods of high stage order having a diagonally implicit scheme.
This makes them ideal candidates for solving large stiff ODE systems arising
from semi-discretized PDEs.

In this talk we will review the construction of some implicit general linear methods. We will
discuss variable step sizes and we will present numerical results.
